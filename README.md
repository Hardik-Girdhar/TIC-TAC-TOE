# TIC-TAC-TOE

**Introduction**

This lecture from "The Complete JavaScript Series" by Shraddha Khapra covers building a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript. The video starts with an overview of the game and its rules, emphasizing that it's a great way to practice core JavaScript concepts like arrays, booleans, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and more.

**Building the Tic Tac Toe Game**

The instructor breaks down the game development process into smaller steps:

1.  **HTML Structure:** Create an HTML document with a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell should have a unique identifier.

2.  **CSS Styling:** Style the HTML elements using CSS to make the game visually appealing. This includes setting up the board layout, styling the cells, and adding visual elements like the player's turn indicator.

3.  **JavaScript Logic:** Implement the game logic using JavaScript. This involves:

    -   **Creating an Array to Represent the Game Board:** Create a 2D array to represent the game board, where each cell is initially represented by an empty string.

    -   **Handling Player Turns:** Implement event listeners for each cell to handle player moves. When a cell is clicked, update the corresponding array element with the player's symbol (X or O).

    -   **Checking for Winning Conditions:** After each player's move, check for winning conditions. This involves checking for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of three matching symbols. If a winning condition is met, display a message announcing the winner and end the game.

    -   **Resetting the Game:** Implement a "Reset Game" button that clears the board, resets the game state, and allows players to start a new game.

**Additional Details and Key Takeaways**

-   The video emphasizes the importance of understanding and applying fundamental programming concepts to solve problems.

-   Tic Tac Toe is a simple game but provides a valuable learning experience for practicing core JavaScript concepts.

-   The instructor encourages viewers to explore additional challenges and apply their understanding to more complex projects.

**Conclusion**

This lecture provides a comprehensive guide to building a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, highlighting the practical application of essential programming concepts. By following the steps and understanding the underlying logic, viewers can gain valuable experience in web development and programming fundamentals.

**Building the Game Structure (HTML)**

1.  **Create the HTML Document:** Create an HTML file named `index.html` to serve as the foundation for the web page.

2.  **Set Up the Basic Structure:**
    -   Add a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to specify the HTML version.
    -   Include the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to define the basic structure of the web page.

3.  **Define the Game Title:**
    -   Within the `<head>` section, add a `<title>` tag to set the page title, for example: `<title>Tic Tac Toe Game</title>`.

4.  **Create the Game Container:**
    -   Inside the `<body>` section, add a `<div>` element to act as the container for the entire game.
    -   Give the container a unique class or ID for styling purposes, for example: `<div class="game-container">`.

5.  **Generate the Game Board:**
    -   Within the game container, create a `<table>` element to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
    -   Use `<tr>` and `<td>` elements to create a 3x3 grid of cells.
    -   Assign unique IDs or classes to each cell for easy identification and manipulation.

6.  **Add Visual Elements:**
    -   Optionally, add visual elements like text labels or images to enhance the game's appearance.

**Styling the Game (CSS)**

1.  **Create the CSS File:**
    -   Create a CSS file named `style.css` to define the styles for the game elements.

2.  **Style the Game Container:**
    -   Set appropriate styles for the game container, such as dimensions, background color, and padding.

3.  **Style the Game Board:**
    -   Style the `<table>` element to define the board's overall appearance, including border, cell spacing, and background color.

4.  **Style the Game Cells:**
    -   Style the individual `<td>` elements to represent the playable cells.
    -   Set appropriate styles for cell dimensions, border, background color, and hover effects.

5.  **Style Visual Elements:**
    -   Style any additional visual elements added to the game, such as text labels or images.

**Next Steps**

1.  **Implement Game Logic (JavaScript):**
    -   Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`) to handle the game logic and functionality.
    -   Use JavaScript event listeners to detect clicks on the game cells.
    -   Update the game state based on player moves and check for winning conditions.
    -   Display appropriate messages or updates after each move or game outcome.

2.  **Enhance the Game (Optional):**
    -   Add features like player names, turn indicators, and a reset button.
    -   Implement AI or multiplayer functionality.
    -   Create a responsive design for different screen sizes.
