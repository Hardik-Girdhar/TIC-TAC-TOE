# TIC-TAC-TOE

**Introduction**

The Project starts with an overview of the game and its rules, emphasizing that it's a great way to practice core JavaScript concepts like arrays, booleans, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and more.

**Building the Tic Tac Toe Game**


1.  **HTML Structure:** Create an HTML document with a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell should have a unique identifier.

2.  **CSS Styling:** Style the HTML elements using CSS to make the game visually appealing. This includes setting up the board layout, styling the cells, and adding visual elements like the player's turn indicator.

3.  **JavaScript Logic:** Implement the game logic using JavaScript. This involves:

    -   **Creating an Array to Represent the Game Board:** Create a 2D array to represent the game board, where each cell is initially represented by an empty string.

    -   **Handling Player Turns:** Implement event listeners for each cell to handle player moves. When a cell is clicked, update the corresponding array element with the player's symbol (X or O).

    -   **Checking for Winning Conditions:** After each player's move, check for winning conditions. This involves checking for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of three matching symbols. If a winning condition is met, display a message announcing the winner and end the game.

    -   **Resetting the Game:** Implement a "Reset Game" button that clears the board, resets the game state, and allows players to start a new game.

**Additional Details and Key Takeaways**

-   The project emphasizes the importance of understanding and applying fundamental programming concepts to solve problems.

-   Tic Tac Toe is a simple game but provides a valuable learning experience for practicing core JavaScript concepts.

-   The instructor encourages viewers to explore additional challenges and apply their understanding to more complex projects.

**Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, highlighting the practical application of essential programming concepts.
